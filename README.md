## Goals

- [x] Provide basic topographical maps for all Squad maps
- [ ] Add topographical maps in SVG format, since it does not require a static resolution
- [ ] Add contour-line height marks
- [ ] Add highways/streets/paths to the topographical maps
- [ ] Add forests to the topographical maps (marked with green)
- [ ] Add city buildings to the topographical maps (marked with grey)
- [ ] Add mountain top marks aswell as several height marks
- [ ] Add city and general location names

For all objectives listed above, the main goal is to provide a way to automagically (I love this adjective) generate topgraphically maps. All resources needed to generate the topographical maps, unless there are copyright problems with uploading such, should be provide within this repository.
